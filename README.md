# Data_Structures_Points_Project

At this project an imput file of 2D points is parsed and the points are inserted via a 2DTree which is created on class TreeNode (inside class TwoDTree). <br> 
Then the user can parse as an input a 2D point or a Rectangle with the dimensions of each. <br>
For rectangle the user can find out the 2Dpoints located inside Rectangle, and for 2DPoint the nearest 2D point of above dataset.
